                    Skincare can feel like a world of products and ingredients — but when you understand what each one does, it becomes a lot less confusing and a lot more fun. In this section, I’ll break down some of the key products and ingredients that help keep your skin healthy at every age. From the must-have sunscreen that protects you daily, to ingredients like niacinamide and retinol that fine-tune your skin’s balance and glow, this page will help you see why these essentials really matter.

                    Skincare can feel like a whole universe of products and ingredients — and honestly, it’s easy to get overwhelmed by it. With so many labels, trends, and routines on social media, it can start to feel like you need a 12-step routine just to have “good skin.” But the truth is, skincare becomes a lot simpler (and way more enjoyable) once you understand what each product is actually doing for you.
                </p>
                <p class="left-skew align-right">
                    This section is here to break things down in a way that feels clear, realistic, and easy to follow. Instead of throwing a bunch of products at you, we’re focusing on the essentials that make the biggest difference. Think of this page like your cheat-sheet: what each key product does, why it matters, and how it supports your skin over time.

                    Whether your goal is preventing early damage, keeping your skin balanced, or just building a routine that finally makes sense, these basics are the foundation. Sunscreen protects and prevents future issues. Niacinamide strengthens and smooths. Acids refresh and renew. Retinol supports long-term glow and texture. When you know the “why” behind each one, picking products becomes less confusing — and way more personal to what your skin actually needs.

                    <strong>Sunscreen: The Non-Negotiable</strong>
                    If skincare had one rule, it would be to wear sunscreen. It’s not just for summer — it’s an everyday essential that protects your
                    skin from ultraviolet (UV) rays responsible for aging, dark spots, and even skin cancer. UV damage builds up quietly over time,
                    even through clouds or windows. A daily, broad-spectrum SPF 30 or higher is the best way to maintain strong, healthy skin.
                    <br><em>Why it matters:</em>
                    Prevents wrinkles and loss of firmness, Reduces hyperpigmentation and uneven tone, Protects against long-term sun damage.
                    No other product works if sunscreen isn’t part of the routine. It’s the foundation of all healthy skin.
                </p>

                    <strong>Niacinamide:</strong> The Multitasker
                    Niacinamide (Vitamin B3) is one of skincare’s most balanced, versatile ingredients. It supports the skin barrier,
                    <br><strong>Benefits:</strong>
                    Strengthens the skin’s natural defenses, reduces redness and smooths roughness,
                    Minimizes pores and balances oil, Fades dullness and uneven color.
                    It works with nearly every ingredient, making it perfect for all skin types and routines.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Retinol:</strong> The Gold Standard of Renewal
                    Retinol, derived from Vitamin A, boosts cell turnover and collagen production — revealing smoother, brighter skin over time.
                    <br><br><strong>By age:</strong><br>
                    <em>20s</em>: Gentle formulas prevent early fine lines.
                    <br><em>30s</em>: Moderate strength to maintain firmness.
                    <br><em>40s</em>: Stronger forms help restore elasticity and texture.
                    Used consistently, retinol can transform skin’s appearance and strength.
                    <br><br><strong>Acids:</strong> The Smart Exfoliators
                    Exfoliating acids remove dead skin cells to reveal a smoother, clearer surface. They’re chemical exfoliants — gentler and more even than scrubs.
                    <br><strong>Types of acids:</strong>
                    <br><em>BHAs (Beta Hydroxy Acids):</em> Clear clogged pores and reduce oil. <br>Example: Salicylic Acid.
                    <br><em>PHAs (Polyhydroxy Acids):</em> Mild exfoliation with added hydration. <br>Examples: Gluconolactone, Lactobionic Acid.
                    <br><br>
